# Rat Rig V-core 3 Klipper Config
# Specifically made for the SKR Pro 1.2
# In case of another board / printer, you can overwrite this file 
# with your own config.

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment 
# the files and/or settings you need.
# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:
# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

### BASE SETUP
[include v-core-3/v-core-3.cfg]
[include v-core-3/steppers.cfg]
# Uncomment this next line if you have an ADXL345 connected to the SKR PRO
#[include v-core-3/adxl345.cfg] 

### HOMING
# Z-Probe
[include v-core-3/bltouch.cfg]
[bltouch]
z_offset: 0.0 # Adjust this to fit your setup

# Physical endstops
[include v-core-3/physical-endstops.cfg]
[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position: 150,150 # 300mm printer
#home_xy_position: 200,200 # 400mm printer
#home_xy_position: 250,250 # 500mm printer

# Endstop position
# Adjust this to your setup
# Note: might need fine tuning.
[stepper_y]
position_endstop: 300  # 300mm printer
#position_endstop: 400 # 400mm printer
#position_endstop: 500 # 500mm printer

# Sensorless homing (Beware: this requires tinkering and does not work if your x/y stepper drivers
# have clipped DIAG pins).
#[include v-core-3/sensorless-homing.cfg]

### PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS
# Remove the # from your printer size below. 
# Similarly add a # in front of [include v-core-3/300.cfg] if you have a bigger machine.
[include v-core-3/300.cfg]
#[include v-core-3/400.cfg]
#[include v-core-3/500.cfg]

### SPEED & ACCEL
# Acceleration
# Check https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html for input shaper calibration.
[include v-core-3/speed-limits-basic.cfg]
# Do not enable this next line without actively cooled steppers.
#[include v-core-3/speed-limits-performance.cfg]


### EXTRUSION
[include v-core-3/bmg.cfg]
[include v-core-3/v6.cfg]

# Pressure Advance
# Check https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html for pressure advance tuning.
[extruder]
pressure_advance: 0.06

### HOTEND HEATING
# PID Tuning (Remember to run PID tuning before printing)
control: pid
pid_kp: 28.413
pid_ki: 1.334
pid_kd: 151.300

### BED HEATING
# BED PID Tuning (Remember to run PID tuning before printing)
[heater_bed]
control: pid
pid_Kp: 22.2
pid_Ki: 1.08
pid_Kd: 114


### MACROS
[include v-core-3/macros.cfg]

# Print macros. Call these from your slicer (custom g-code). 
# You can Modify these to your liking.
# Prusa Slicer Example:
# START_PRINT EXTRUDER_TEMP=[first_layer_temperature] BED_TEMP=[first_layer_bed_temperature]
# M190 S[first_layer_bed_temperature] ; Prevents prusaslicer from prepending this to the gcode.
# M109 S[first_layer_temperature] ; Prevents prusaslicer from prepending this to the gcode.
[gcode_macro START_PRINT]
gcode:
  SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=start_print_state
  G21 ;metric values
  G90 ;absolute positioning
  M82 ;set extruder to absolute mode
  G28 ;home
  M117 Heating...
  M190 S{params.BED_TEMP|default(printer.heater_bed.target, true) }; wait for bed to heat up
  M109 S150 ; Wait for extruder to reach 150 so an inductive probe (if present) is at a predictable temp. Also allows the bed heat to spread a little.
  Z_TILT_ADJUST ;Adjust bed tilt
  G28 Z ;Home again as Z will have changed after tilt adjustment and bed heating.
  BED_MESH_CALIBRATE ; Calibrate bed mesh
  G0 X{printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.x / 2} Y{printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.y} Z50 F6000 ; Park in the back and wait for extruder
  M109 S{params.EXTRUDER_TEMP|default(printer.extruder.target, true) }; wait for extruder to heat up
  M117 Printing...

# The end_print macro is also called from CANCEL_PRINT.
[gcode_macro END_PRINT]
gcode:

  M140 S0 ;heated bed heater off
